Here's an example of a simple plugin for DevNest named Plugin.py. This plugin will demonstrate how to integrate with the DevNest editor by adding a command to count the number of words in the currently open document. The code includes comments to explain how it works:


# Plugin.py

# Import necessary modules
from devnest import DevNestPlugin  # Import the base class for plugins
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMessageBox  # For displaying messages

class WordCountPlugin(DevNestPlugin):
    """
    A simple plugin for DevNest that counts the number of words
    in the currently active text editor and displays the result.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.plugin_name = "Word Count Plugin"  # The name of the plugin
        self.plugin_description = "Counts the number of words in the current document."  # Description of the plugin

    def run(self):
        """
        The method that runs when the plugin is executed.
        It retrieves the text from the current editor, counts the words, and shows the result in a message box.
        """
        editor = self.get_current_editor()  # Get the currently active editor
        if editor:  # Check if an editor is open
            text = editor.toPlainText()  # Get the text from the editor
            word_count = self.count_words(text)  # Count the words in the text
            self.show_word_count(word_count)  # Display the word count
        else:
            QMessageBox.warning(None, "Error", "No active editor found.")  # Show an error if no editor is open

    def count_words(self, text):
        """
        Counts the number of words in the provided text.
        
        Args:
            text (str): The text to count words in.
        
        Returns:
            int: The number of words in the text.
        """
        # Split the text by whitespace and filter out empty strings
        words = [word for word in text.split() if word]
        return len(words)  # Return the count of words

    def show_word_count(self, count):
        """
        Displays the word count in a message box.
        
        Args:
            count (int): The word count to display.
        """
        # Create and show a message box with the word count
        QMessageBox.information(None, "Word Count", f"The document contains {count} words.")

# This block is only run if the plugin is executed directly (not imported)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    plugin = WordCountPlugin()  # Create an instance of the plugin
    plugin.run()  # Run the plugin
Explanation of the Code:
Importing Modules:

The plugin imports DevNestPlugin, which is the base class for all plugins in DevNest, and QMessageBox for displaying message boxes.
Class Definition:

The WordCountPlugin class inherits from DevNestPlugin. This allows it to integrate with the DevNest editor.
Initialization:

The __init__ method sets the plugin's name and description.
Running the Plugin:

The run method is executed when the plugin is triggered. It retrieves the text from the current editor and counts the number of words using the count_words method. If no editor is open, it displays an error message.
Counting Words:

The count_words method splits the text into words based on whitespace and counts them, returning the total.
Displaying the Word Count:

The show_word_count method displays the word count in a message box.
Main Block:

The last block of code ensures that the plugin can be executed directly for testing purposes.
